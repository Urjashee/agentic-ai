**Chosen Company for Investment: Yiren Digital Ltd. (Ticker: NYSE: YRD)**

**Reason for Selection:**
1. **Financial Performance:** Yiren Digital has demonstrated strong financial performance, including a significant net revenue growth of 10% year-over-year in Q2 2025.
2. **Dividends:** The company is continually increasing its dividends, which indicates financial stability and a shareholder-friendly approach.
3. **Market Performance:** With an average projected stock price of $11.38 in 2025, Yiren Digital shows strong market performance and investor confidence.
4. **Publicly Traded:** Being publicly traded on the NYSE provides liquidity advantages and transparency compared to private investments.

**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **Perplexity AI:**
   - **Reason for Non-Selection:** Although Perplexity AI displays significant growth potential and has increased its valuation substantially, it remains a private entity, which may pose liquidity risks. The financial trajectory is promising, but the uncertainties of being a private investment and the volatility associated with start-ups are potential risks.

2. **Anthropic:**
   - **Reason for Non-Selection:** Anthropic, while enjoying a strong market position and valued highly post-Series E funding, is also private, facing similar liquidity risks as Perplexity AI. Additionally, while its enterprise adoption is commendable, the strategic initiatives and focus on reducing cash burn suggest potential financial challenges.

**Summary:**
Within the context of current market dynamics and investment strategies, Yiren Digital Ltd. presents itself as the most attractive investment opportunity due to its financial stability, strong market performance, and the advantage of being publicly traded. In contrast, while Perplexity AI and Anthropic show significant potential as private companies, they carry higher risks which may not align with a balanced investment approach focusing on liquidity and short-to-medium term returns.
