# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
total = 0

# Calculate the sum of the series
for i in range(10000):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # even index, add the term
        total += 1 / (2 * i + 1)
    else:           # odd index, subtract the term
        total -= 1 / (2 * i + 1)

# Multiply the total by 4
result = total * 4

# Print the final result
print(result)
